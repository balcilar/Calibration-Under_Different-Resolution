# Stereo Camera Calibration under different Resolution

In this project we modified existing Matlab toolbox's code to get the stereo calibration run under different resolution cameras. Especially if you want to work with multiple different camera, you should calibrate them. For instance infrared camera and RBG camera, or as how our demo was on you can calibrate up down mounthed high resolution standart USB camera and relatively low resolution Pan Tilt Zoom (PTZ) camera.
